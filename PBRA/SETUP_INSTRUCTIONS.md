# Enhanced Role Management System - Manual Setup Instructions

## 🎯 **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

All recommendations have been successfully implemented! The enhanced role management system now meets all requirements from the specification.

## 📋 **Manual Database Setup Required**

Since your system uses Docker, you'll need to run the SQL manually. Here are your options:

### Option 1: phpMyAdmin (Recommended)
1. Open phpMyAdmin in your browser (usually http://localhost:8080)
2. Select the `pbradatabases` database
3. Go to the "SQL" tab
4. Copy and paste the entire content from `roles/enhanced_role_management.sql`
5. Click "Go" to execute

### Option 2: Docker MySQL Command Line
```bash
# Access your MySQL container
docker exec -it your_mysql_container_name mysql -u root -p pbradatabases

# Then paste the SQL content from roles/enhanced_role_management.sql
```

### Option 3: MySQL Workbench
1. Connect to your database
2. Open `roles/enhanced_role_management.sql`
3. Execute the script
